## 🎯 Problem Statement

The business lacks a consolidated view of sales performance across time, product categories, customer segments, and cities. Without this insight, it becomes difficult to:
Identify top-performing and underperforming products
Understand customer purchasing behavior
Track year-over-year performance
Make informed strategic and operational decisions

## 🎯 Project Aim
To analyze historical sales data and visualize key performance trends in order to identify growth patterns, customer behavior, and category-level performance drivers.

## ✅ Project Objectives
Analyze quarterly and yearly sales trends from 2014 to 2017

Compare year-over-year sales performance across product sub-categories

Evaluate sales contribution by customer segment

Identify top-performing and declining cities

Provide data-driven insights and business recommendations

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of sales transaction records with the following key attributes:

Time: Year, Quarter

Products: Category, Sub-Category

Customers: Segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)

Geography: City

Metrics: Sales values with year-over-year comparisons

The data was cleaned, aggregated, and transformed to support accurate analysis and visualization.
